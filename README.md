# StellarResonance

A Dalamud-style plugin framework for **Blue Protocol: Star Resonance** (Tencent SEA, executable `StarSEA.exe`). It loads via BepInEx 6 IL2CPP, drives an in-game **uGUI** overlay, and hosts third-party C# plugins behind a clean, read-only service API.

> ⚠️ **Experimental.** Verified against Unity 2022.3.59f1 LTS, IL2CPP. Future game patches may break the framework. You are responsible for understanding your game's Terms of Service before installing any client-side modifications.

> **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the game's publisher or developer.** "Stellar" and "StellarResonance" refer to *this framework*, not to the game. This project ships **no game code, assets, or binaries** (see [Disclaimers](#disclaimers)) and exists purely for interoperability and quality-of-life research, in the spirit of FFXIV's Dalamud.

---

## Purpose: quality-of-life only — **no cheating**

This framework exists for **client-side quality-of-life modifications** — the same niche FFXIV's Dalamud occupies: chat enhancements, UI overlays, performance and player HUDs, log viewers, accessibility helpers, debug tooling.

The architecture enforces this by design: plugins reference only `Stellar.Abstractions`, which contains zero APIs for memory or raw-network access. They physically cannot reach lower-level capabilities — the build fails.

If you want to write a plugin that does any of the above, **do not use this framework.** Pull requests adding cheat-shaped capabilities will be rejected.

---

## Architecture

Five assemblies, Clean Architecture, with the dependency rule enforced at compile time by project references:

```
Plugin DLL
    │ references
    ▼
Stellar.Abstractions    — plugin-facing contracts only (IPluginServices, IFramework, …); BCL-only
    ▲           ▲
Stellar.Application     Stellar.Wire   — use cases / services + outbound interfaces (App);
    ▲                                    wire-protocol parsing + routing (Wire). Both BCL-only.
    ▲
Stellar.Infrastructure  — the only layer that touches BepInEx / HarmonyX / Unity IL2CPP /
    ▲                      Il2CppInterop / MessagePipe / the game's Panda.* assemblies
Stellar.Host            — BepInEx [BepInPlugin] composition root; wires Infrastructure into Application
```

**The dependency rule:** arrows point inward. `Abstractions` references nothing outside the .NET BCL. `Application` and `Wire` reference `Abstractions` only. `Infrastructure` is the sole layer permitted to reference BepInEx, HarmonyX, Unity, Il2CppInterop, or game (`Panda.*`) assemblies — it implements the outbound interfaces `Application` declares. `Host` references everything and performs DI wire-up, but contains no business logic.

Plugins reference **only** `Stellar.Abstractions.dll` (plus `UnityEngine.*` if they draw directly). They physically cannot touch framework internals — the build fails.

Deeper detail: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## What the framework gives you

- **Plugins as C# DLLs.** Drop a `.dll` into `<game_mini>/stellar/plugins/<your-plugin>/` and it loads at startup. A plugin is a single class implementing `IStellarPlugin` with a constructor that takes `IPluginServices` — no other boilerplate.
- **A broad, read-only service surface** via `IPluginServices`: framework lifecycle and per-frame tick (`IFramework`), session and scene state (`IClientState`), game events (`IGameEvents`), live player state and stats (`IPlayerState`, `IPlayerStats`), inventory and module equip (`IInventory`, `IModuleEquip`), chat (`IChat`), combat snapshots/events/lookup (`ICombatSnapshot`, `ICombatEvents`, `ICombatLookup`), party roster/snapshot/events, static game tables (`IGameData`), persistent config (`IPluginConfig`), theming (`ITheme`, `INamedTheme`), hotkeys (`IHotkeys`), game assets (`IGameAssets`), and the UI toolkits below.
- **A uGUI UI toolkit.** Plugins describe their UI declaratively as a `HudElement` tree, and the framework renders it as native Unity uGUI:
  - `IHudHost` — register non-interactive HUD overlays (HP bars, meters, status strips).
  - `IWindowHost` — register draggable, interactive windows with title bars and close buttons.
  - `INativeUiHost` — inject mod UI (menu buttons, indicators, panels) into the game's own UI anchors.
  - `ILauncher` — register a tile in the Stellar launcher menu.
- **Lifecycle integration.** Login / logout / scene-change and per-frame `Update` callbacks are delivered to your plugin from the game's own `Panda.Core.Game.*` methods via HarmonyX patches.

## Sample plugins

Reference plugins (DebugInfo, PlayerHUD, StatInspector, CombatMeter, CooldownBar, ChatTools, DataInspector, ModuleOptimizer, …) live in the **separate plugins repository** — plugin code is kept out of the framework so the two evolve independently. Each plugin demonstrates a slice of the API (declarative HUDs, combat/inventory/chat services, game-validated actions). See the plugins repo for source and the [developer guide](docs/plugin-development.md) for how to build your own.

---

## Writing a plugin

A plugin is a single .NET 6 class library that references **only** `Stellar.Abstractions` (and optionally `UnityEngine.*`), and exports one public type implementing `IStellarPlugin`:

```csharp
public interface IStellarPlugin : IDisposable
{
    string Name { get; }
}
```

The framework constructs your plugin once via constructor injection of `IPluginServices`, then calls `Dispose()` on shutdown. From the constructor you read whatever sub-services you need off `IPluginServices`, subscribe to events, register HUDs/windows, and store the references for cleanup.

A typical HUD plugin describes its layout as a `HudElement` tree, registers it with `IPluginServices.Hud` (or `.Windows` for an interactive window), and updates state on the `IFramework.Update` tick or in response to a domain event. See **PlayerHUD** and **DebugInfo** for the smallest complete examples.

The full developer guide — every service interface, the plugin lifecycle, the uGUI toolkit, and the mandatory IL2CPP-aware quirks — is in [**`docs/plugin-development.md`**](docs/plugin-development.md). For the complete generated **API reference** (every public interface/type you can consume), see [**`docs/api/`**](docs/api/) — start at [`IPluginServices`](docs/api/Stellar.Abstractions.Services/IPluginServices.md).

Drop the built DLL into a subfolder of `<game_mini>/stellar/plugins/`; the framework scans `stellar/plugins/**/*.dll` at startup, finds your `IStellarPlugin`, and constructs it.

## Build and install

### Prerequisites

- The game installed on **Windows** (native) or **Linux** (Wine/Proton — Heroic / Lutris / Bottles). Locate the `game_mini` folder:
  - Windows: `…\Star\StarLauncher\game\release_<ver>\game_mini\`
  - Linux: `<prefix>/drive_c/Star/StarLauncher/game/release_<ver>/game_mini/`
- **.NET SDK** (8.0+) to build the framework and plugins (Windows / Linux / macOS).
- The **BepInEx 6 IL2CPP** loader installed into the `game_mini` folder (one-time).

New here? Start with the [**getting-started guide**](docs/getting-started.md) — it covers both Windows and Linux, and the easiest path (the cross-platform launcher).

### Build

```bash
dotnet build src/Stellar.sln -c Release
```

Build a single project:

```bash
dotnet build src/Stellar.Application/Stellar.Application.csproj -c Release
```

Output DLLs land in each project's `bin/Release/`. `src/Directory.Build.props` carries the shared TFM (`net6.0`) and the `GameInterop` path to the game's generated IL2CPP interop assemblies — override on the command line if your install differs:

```bash
dotnet build src/Stellar.sln -c Release -p:GameInterop=/your/path/to/game_mini/BepInEx/interop
```

### Install

**Linux:**

```bash
tools/install-bepinex.sh   # one-time — installs the BepInEx loader
tools/install-stellar.sh   # deploy the framework to the game
```

Set `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winhttp=n,b` in your launcher's per-game env vars so Wine loads the Doorstop proxy.

**Windows:** copy the built DLLs from `src/Stellar.Host/bin/Release/` (Host, Infrastructure, Application, Abstractions, Wire + `ZstdSharp.dll`) into `<game_mini>\BepInEx\plugins\Stellar.Framework\`; the BepInEx `winhttp.dll` proxy loads natively (no env var needed). You can also run the bash scripts from Git Bash / WSL.

Either way, the framework DLLs live in `<game_mini>/BepInEx/plugins/Stellar.Framework/` and plugin DLLs go under `<game_mini>/stellar/plugins/<plugin>/`. The BepInEx log is at `<game_mini>/BepInEx/LogOutput.log` — start there if anything's wrong.

> The easiest install on **both** platforms is the [StellarResonance Launcher](https://github.com/StellarProtocol/StellarResonance), which does all of the above for you.

## Disclaimers

- **Game ToS.** Modifying the client may violate Star Resonance's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk; account actions taken by the publisher are your responsibility.
- **No game binaries redistributed.** This repository contains no content extracted from the game — no Cpp2IL output, no `Panda.*` interop stubs, no asset dumps. You generate those locally from your own install.
- **No warranty.** This is experimental research software. It can crash the game, corrupt the BepInEx install, or stop working entirely after a game patch.
